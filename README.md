## About

Hey there! I'm Mack Predelus, a passionate coder and technology enthusiast. I was born and raised in the vibrant city of Miami, Florida, and I've always been driven by a sense of purpose and a hunger for new challenges. I earned a Bachelor's degree in Exercise Science from the University of West Florida. After graduating, I served my country as a Jet Engine Mechanic in the Air Force Reserves. Currently I am diving headfirst into the world of coding at the University of Denver's Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp.
