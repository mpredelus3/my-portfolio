                Hey there! I'm Mack Predelus. I was born and raised in the vibrant city of Miami, Florida, I've always
                been driven by a sense of purpose and a hunger for new challenges. After high school, I decided to serve
                my country, spending six impactful years as a Jet Engine Mechanic in the Air Force Reserves. Following
                my service, I pursued my passion for knowledge, earning a Bachelor's degree in Exercise Science from the
                University of West Florida in 2017. Currently, I'm diving headfirst into the world of coding at the
                University of Denver's Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp. It's an exhilarating journey, filled with late-night
                coding sessions, problem-solving puzzles, and the joy of seeing lines of code come to life. During the
                day, you'll find me wearing my AT&T hat as an In-Home Expert, where I get to connect with people
                everyday. It's a role that keeps me grounded while I work towards my career in technology.
